// Write a function that performs a binary search recursively.

// As a reminder, binary search is where you start in the middle of a 
// sorted array, and check to see whether the number you're looking for is
//    1. That number
//    2. Greater than that number (in this case, search again on the right side)
//    3. Less than that number (in this case, search again on the left side)

// Return a boolean for whether or not the number is in the array
function rBinarySearch(array, num ) {
